= Applying [http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/ BitBlaze] to Diff =

We use temu-1.0 to obtain a trace file named "diff.p.tr" when invoking diffutils-2.8.1 with the command 
{{{
diff -u a b
}}} 
(for details of the command, see [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=577832 this link]) However, vine-1.0 failed to convert the trace file into VINE intermediate representation, raising an error message 
{{{
Fatal error: exception Vine.VineError("label_to_addr given non address-like label")
}}}
