We use temu-1.0 to obtain a trace file named "diff.p.tr" when invoking diffutils-2.8.1 with the command "" .(for details of the command, see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=577832) However, vine-1.0 failed to convert the trace file into VINE intermediate representation, raising an error message 
{{{
Fatal error: exception Vine.VineError("label_to_addr given non address-like label")
}}}
